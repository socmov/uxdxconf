<h2>Disclosure</h2>
<p>All attendees for UXDX, excluding contact information, will be listed on our website to enable all attendees to identify
  people they would like to meet with and improve the networking experience for everyone at the conference.</p>
<p>Personal contact information will not be disclosed on the website or to third parties unless we have your permission. We
  may make non-personal information available to third parties, such as Google Analytics, to enable reporting on website
  visits and behaviours.</p>
<p>We do have external links to third party websites, such as links to sponsor websites, which are visibly defined as such
  throughout the website. We are not responsible for the content or privacy policies of these other websites.</p>
<p>We will provide your personal information if we are required to by any applicable law, a summons, a search warrant, a court
  order or other statutory requirement.</p>
<p>In the event of a sale, merger, receivership, liquidation we reserve the right to transfer all or largely all of our company’s
  assets, including your personal information, to a third party as long as the third party only uses your personal information
  for the purposes for which you provided it to us and only if the third party agrees to follow the terms of this Privacy
  Policy. You will be contacted in the event of any such transfer and given the option to withdraw your connection with
  the website.</p>

<h2>Restricting the Use of your Personal Information</h2>
<p>All direct contact with you will include an unsubscribe link. If you wish to be removed from the attendee list you may
  contact us at any time at
  <a href="mailto:connect@uxdxconf.com">connect@uxdxconf.com</a> should you wish to be removed.</p>

<h2>Right of Access</h2>
<p>Under section 4 of the Acts, you have a right to be given a copy of your personal data. This is called a “Right of Access”.
  Should you wish to access this information, you must send a Subject Access Request email to
  <a href="mailto:connect@uxdxconf.com">connect@uxdxconf.com</a>. We will send a response to the link where the processing fee of €6.35 can be paid. We will
  respond to your request within 40 calendar days of payment. Included in the request should be a copy of your driver’s
  licence or passport.</p>

<h2>Right of Rectification or Erasure</h2>

  in the paragraph above entitled “Right of Access”. Please note there is no fee for this request and we shall comply within
  40 calendar days of the receipt of such a request.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card
  number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). However,
  no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive
  to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security
  and cannot accept any liability where the security of your Personal Information is compromised.</p>

<h2>Retention</h2>
<p>Data will not be held for longer than is necessary for the purpose(s) for which they were obtained. Our policy is to delete
  credit card details once a transaction had been finalised, unless you consent to retain details to ease future transactions.</p>

<h2>Amendments to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Should any modifications to this privacy policy be undertaken, a clearly visible notification will be placed on the website
  so that all users are fully aware of what data we collect, how that data is used, and if and why it is disclosed.</p>
<p>If we ever decide to use personal information in a considerably different manner to that described in this privacy policy,
  or otherwise stated to you when you agreed to provide your details, we will inform you by email and you will consequently
  be able to choose whether or not to permit us to use your information in the amended manner.</p>

<h1>Refund and Cancellation Policy</h1>
<p>All purchases of tickets for conferences and events (including hotel rooms if applicable) are non-refundable in their entirety.
  Your ticket remains the property of Socially Motivated Limited and is a personal revocable license, which may be withdrawn,
  and admission refused at any time upon a refund of the printed registration price.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event of cancellation of a conference or event the liability of Socially Motivated Limited is limited to
  the share of paid registration fees that remains after credit card and payment processing fees have been incurred and
  deducted.</p>
<p>It is strictly forbidden for any company, organisation or attendee to attempt to host or organise any event in conjunction
  with, contiguous to or purporting to be related to UXDX or its affiliates without the express prior permission and cooperation
  of Socially Motivated Limited. In the event of breach of these terms any tickets purchased by the organiser and their
  affiliates will be rendered null and void. Socially Motivated Limited reserves their right to take such legal action
  including a claim for damages as may be appropriate.</p>
<p>The tickets purchased (including hotel rooms if applicable) are for your own personal use or that of your business only
  and may not be re-sold or transferred for commercial gain under any circumstances, including but not limited to use as
  part of any promotion or competition. Where there has been any re-sale or attempted re-sale of any tickets (or any other
  breach of this term), we reserve the right to cancel the relevant tickets with immediate effect.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to cancel any ticket purchase made by any person or body whom we reasonably believe to be associated
  with any ticket broker or tout.</p>
<p>Socially Motivated Limited reserves the right to refuse admission to any event or conference for any behaviour, which it
  deems unacceptable, or for breach of the terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Socially Motivated Limited will not be responsible for any tickets that are lost or stolen. The unauthorised use of photographic
  and recording equipment at events and conferences is prohibited.</p>
<p>Socially Motivated Limited will not be liable for any loss injury or damage to any person or property howsoever caused
  (save for death or personal injury as a result of Socially Motivated Limited’s negligence or for any other type of liability
  that cannot by law be excluded or limited.)</p>
<p>Socially Motivated Limited will not be liable for the granting of any VISAs that are required to attend any event or conference.
  In the event that an attendee’s VISA is not granted tickets will not be refunded for any event or conference.</p>
<p>In the event that the purchaser is a consumer and to whom the European Directive on Consumer Rights (Directive 2011 / 83/
  EU) applies, the consumer would be entitled to a cooling off period of fourteen days which would begin on the day the
  contract for distance selling was concluded.</p>

<h1>Event Cancellation, Postponement &amp; Substitution Policy</h1>
<p>Socially Motivated Limited is not responsible for any loss or damage as a result of a substitution, alteration, cancellation
  or postponement of an event. Socially Motivated Limited shall assume no liability whatsoever in the circumstances that
  an event is cancelled, rescheduled or postponed due to a fortuitous event, Act of God, unforeseen occurrence or any other
  event that renders performance of an event impracticable, illegal or impossible. For purposes of this clause, a fortuitous
  event shall include, but not be limited to: war, fire, labour strike, extreme weather or other emergency.</p>
<p>Please note that while speakers and topics are confirmed at the time of publishing, circumstances beyond the control of
  the organisers may necessitate substitutions, alterations or cancellations of the speakers and/or topics. As such, Socially
  Motivated Limited reserves the right to alter or modify the advertised speakers and/or topics if necessary without any
  liability to you whatsoever. Any substitutions or alterations will be updated on our web page as soon as possible.</p>

<h1>Delivery Policy</h1>
<p>Once a successful purchase transaction has been completed, tickets are delivered in electronic soft-copy via email to the
  email address nominated by the purchaser. For some ticket types it may be necessary to complete required information
  – such as attendee name – before the tickets can be issued. The ticket acts as a receipt for the transaction and can
  be used to redeem entry at the event listed on the ticket. A printed hard-copy ticket or an electronic soft-copy ticket
  detailing the reference number can be used to register at the event.</p>
