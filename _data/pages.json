With a wide range of experience from working as an investment professional at legendary private equity firm GTCR to working as a product manager at Microsoft to serving as CEO of Strategyn, Jay has seen first-hand the problems that executives and product teams confront when trying to satisfy customers and generate growth and equity value for shareholders. Jay is an innovation thought-leader who has contributed significant advancements to jobs-to- be-done methods. Jay's advancements enable product teams to dramatically increase their effectiveness in using jobs-to-be-done to reduce roadmap risk, accelerate revenue growth, and generate superior equity value. Jobs-to-be-done product management helps CEOs align their product teams with customers and focus their company's product development on exploiting competitor weaknesses from the view of the customer.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Jobs-to-be-done is the best way for CEOs and company boards to assess and mitigate product roadmap risk because it reveals the unambiguous and actionable metrics that customers use to judge product satisfaction. thrv was created from Jay's years of experience working with CEOs, boards, and product teams in a diverse range of industries from B2B to B2C to medical. While at the Harvard Business School, Jay studied with Clay Christensen, who pioneered the concept of disruption and popularized the jobs-to-be-done innovation method. While serving as an Adjunct Professor at the Presidio School of Management, Jay developed methods to train executives and product managers to use jobs-to-be-done effectively. Before founding thrv, Jay served as CEO of Strategyn, where he worked with some of the world's leading companies to transform their product management into a customer-centric, jobs-to-be-done process. Jay graduated Phi Beta Kappa with highest honors from Brown University, and he received his MBA with distinction from Harvard Business School.</p>","order":14,"profile_picture":[{"description":"jay hynes","url":"https://uxdxconf.com/images/kentico/e4062c9f-a969-46dc-8600-66fdadc6f95b/jay-haynes.jpg"}],"company_logo":[{"description":"thrv","url":"https://uxdxconf.com/images/kentico/7083733e-0660-4817-a137-3c26f22f5110/thrv.svg"}],"twitter":"https://twitter.com/jayhaynes?lang=en","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayhaynes/","github":"","instagram":"","conference":["uxdx18","trainer"],"highlight":["product"]}],"description":"<p><br></p>","questions":"<p><br></p>","conference":["uxdx18"]}],"location":"Vision","stream":[],"conference":["uxdx18"]},{"codename":"n09_30__04_10_2018__execution__web_components","id":"def4c735-c0ae-4184-88ab-3cf53047d1bf","start_time":"2018-10-04T09:30:00Z","duration__mins_":30,"session":[{"codename":"microfrontend_architecture","id":"1f22003b-2765-496f-aaa2-13aad1dcd50c","name":"Micro Frontend Architecture","type":"Talk","speakers":[{"codename":"speaker_luca_mezzalira","id":"4194621c-9d10-4b1f-b6fb-bd9aa11458ad","first_name":"Luca","last_name":"Mezzalira","job_title":"Chief Architect","company":"DAZN","country":"Germany","bio":"<p>Luca a Chief Architect with 15 years of experience, a Google Developer Expert on Web Technologies and the London Javascript community Manager<br>\nHe has had the chance to work on cutting-edge projects for mobile, desktop, web, TVs, set top boxes and embedded devices.<br>\nHe's currently managing DAZN, a sports video platform based on the cloud with millions of users that are watching live and on-demand contents.<br>\n<br>\nHe's the author of Front-End Reactive Architectures published by APress:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://goo.gl/ywAmsx\">https://goo.gl/ywAmsx</a><br>\n<br>\nLuca says the best way to use any programming language is mastering their models, that's why he spent a lot of time studying and researching on topics like OOP, Functional and Reactive programming.<br>\n<br>\nIn his spare time, Luca writes for national and international technical magazines and editors, he's also a technical reviewer for APress, Packt Publishing, Pragmatic Bookshelf and O'Reilly.</p>","order":10,"profile_picture":[{"description":"Image of Luca Mezzalira","url":"https://uxdxconf.com/images/kentico/8d650268-c365-4805-b58f-4aa86ed4bcad/Luca-DAZN2.jpg"}],"company_logo":[{"description":"DAZN logo","url":"https://uxdxconf.com/images/kentico/e1f10e8d-a88b-436c-ad86-6deb8f75ffb5/Logo-White-on-black21.jpg"}],"twitter":"https://twitter.com/lucamezzalira","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucamezzalira/","github":"https://github.com/lucamezzalira","instagram":"","conference":["uxdx18"],"highlight":["dx","dx18"]}],"description":"<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/TFYNlcat1A8\">https://youtu.be/TFYNlcat1A8</a></p>","questions":"<p><br></p>","conference":["uxdx18"]}],"location":"Execution","stream":[{"codename":"build","id":"69c40012-7e13-434f-8a26-fff2afb0ff94","name":"Build","conference":["uxdx18","uxdxstockholm18"]}],"conference":["uxdx18"]},{"codename":"n09_30__04_10_18__vision__jobs_to_be_done","id":"953143a1-d9d5-4663-88be-6b4ab5e11eba","start_time":"2018-10-04T09:30:00Z","duration__mins_":30,"session":[{"codename":"putting_the_customer_first__jobs_to_be_done","id":"92c3c6fd-7357-4afe-a7da-bd975f47dc96","name":"Putting the Customer First: Jobs-to-be-Done","type":"Talk","speakers":[{"codename":"matt_barthelemy__fitbit","id":"c570c12c-b227-4582-8fa4-8ee50d05b309","first_name":"Matt","last_name":"Barthelemy","job_title":"Global Head of UX","company":"FitBit","country":"USA","bio":"<p>For over 20 years, Matt has been making new products and new technologies accessible, attractive, and effective for people.

This is, at some level, the fundamental promise of all technology. Yet if we don't pay close enough attention, our own tools can sometimes get the better of us. Whether it's a team using a prescribed design process, or a company building software to be used by the entire planet, it turns out that these tools can be used in unintended ways. They can break, or grow out of control. And so our job as designers is not just to build things, but sometimes to recognise when we need to take them apart again.

infrastructure is maturing to offer even greater benefits to organisations; from immutable infrastructure to dynamic, short lived environments to experimental sandboxes to developers. With these benefits come additional challenges including infrastructure architecture planning, operational governance and security. At this round table lunch we will have four Microsoft Azure and Codec experts each sharing their insights on the following key areas:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Cloud infrastructure architecture best practices</li>\n  <li>Governance in the cloud</li>\n  <li>Key security threats and mitigants</li>\n  <li>Mobile Device security</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><br></h2>\n<h2>Format</h2>\n<p>The meal will be 3 courses with 20 minutes on each topic.

CEO","company":"thrv","country":"US","bio":"<p>Jay Haynes thrv Founder &amp; CEO thrv was founded by Jay Haynes, an award-winning entrepreneur and an executive with 25 years of software and investing experience. thrv is the result of Jay's work using jobs-to-be- done methods with product teams at Fortune 500 corporations, private-equity sponsored companies, and venture-backed start-ups. With a wide range of experience from working as an investment professional at legendary private equity firm GTCR to working as a product manager at Microsoft to serving as CEO of Strategyn, Jay has seen first-hand the problems that executives and product teams confront when trying to satisfy customers and generate growth and equity value for shareholders. Jay is an innovation thought-leader who has contributed significant advancements to jobs-to- be-done methods. Jay's advancements enable product teams to dramatically increase their effectiveness in using jobs-to-be-done to reduce roadmap risk, accelerate revenue growth, and generate superior equity value. Jobs-to-be-done product management helps CEOs align their product teams with customers and focus their company's product development on exploiting competitor weaknesses from the view of the customer.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Jobs-to-be-done is the best way for CEOs and company boards to assess and mitigate product roadmap risk because it reveals the unambiguous and actionable metrics that customers use to judge product satisfaction. thrv was created from Jay's years of experience working with CEOs, boards, and product teams in a diverse range of industries from B2B to B2C to medical. While at the Harvard Business School, Jay studied with Clay Christensen, who pioneered the concept of disruption and popularized the jobs-to-be-done innovation method. While serving as an Adjunct Professor at the Presidio School of Management, Jay developed methods to train executives and product managers to use jobs-to-be-done effectively. Before founding thrv, Jay served as CEO of Strategyn, where he worked with some of the world's leading companies to transform their product management into a customer-centric, jobs-to-be-done process. Jay graduated Phi Beta Kappa with highest honors from Brown University, and he received his MBA with distinction from Harvard Business School.</p>","order":14,"profile_picture":[{"description":"jay hynes","url":"https://uxdxconf.com/images/kentico/e4062c9f-a969-46dc-8600-66fdadc6f95b/jay-haynes.jpg"}],"company_logo":[{"description":"thrv","url":"https://uxdxconf.com/images/kentico/7083733e-0660-4817-a137-3c26f22f5110/thrv.svg"}],"twitter":"https://twitter.com/jayhaynes?lang=en","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayhaynes/","github":"","instagram":"","conference":["uxdx18","trainer"],"highlight":["product"]}],"description":"<p><br></p>","questions":"<p><br></p>","conference":["uxdx18"]}],"location":"Vision","stream":[],"conference":["uxdx18"]},{"codename":"n09_30__04_10_2018__execution__web_components","id":"def4c735-c0ae-4184-88ab-3cf53047d1bf","start_time":"2018-10-04T09:30:00Z","duration__mins_":30,"session":[{"codename":"microfrontend_architecture","id":"1f22003b-2765-496f-aaa2-13aad1dcd50c","name":"Micro Frontend Architecture","type":"Talk","speakers":[{"codename":"speaker_luca_mezzalira","id":"4194621c-9d10-4b1f-b6fb-bd9aa11458ad","first_name":"Luca","last_name":"Mezzalira","job_title":"Chief Architect","company":"DAZN","country":"Germany","bio":"<p>Luca a Chief Architect with 15 years of experience, a Google Developer Expert on Web Technologies and the London Javascript community Manager<br>\nHe has had the chance to work on cutting-edge projects for mobile, desktop, web, TVs, set top boxes and embedded devices.<br>\nHe's currently managing DAZN, a sports video platform based on the cloud with millions of users that are watching live and on-demand contents.<br>\n<br>\nHe's the author of Front-End Reactive Architectures published by APress:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://goo.gl/ywAmsx\">https://goo.gl/ywAmsx</a><br>\n<br>\nLuca says the best way to use any programming language is mastering their models, that's why he spent a lot of time studying and researching on topics like OOP, Functional and Reactive programming.<br>\n<br>\nIn his spare time, Luca writes for national and international technical magazines and editors, he's also a technical reviewer for APress, Packt Publishing, Pragmatic Bookshelf and O'Reilly.</p>","order":10,"profile_picture":[{"description":"Image of Luca Mezzalira","url":"https://uxdxconf.com/images/kentico/8d650268-c365-4805-b58f-4aa86ed4bcad/Luca-DAZN2.jpg"}],"company_logo":[{"description":"DAZN logo","url":"https://uxdxconf.com/images/kentico/e1f10e8d-a88b-436c-ad86-6deb8f75ffb5/Logo-White-on-black21.jpg"}],"twitter":"https://twitter.com/lucamezzalira","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucamezzalira/","github":"https://github.com/lucamezzalira","instagram":"","conference":["uxdx18"],"highlight":["dx","dx18"]}],"description":"<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/TFYNlcat1A8\">https://youtu.be/TFYNlcat1A8</a></p>","questions":"<p><br></p>","conference":["uxdx18"]}],"location":"Execution","stream":[{"codename":"build","id":"69c40012-7e13-434f-8a26-fff2afb0ff94","name":"Build","conference":["uxdx18","uxdxstockholm18"]}],"conference":["uxdx18"]},{"codename":"n09_30__04_10_18__vision__jobs_to_be_done","id":"953143a1-d9d5-4663-88be-6b4ab5e11eba","start_time":"2018-10-04T09:30:00Z","duration__mins_":30,"session":[{"codename":"putting_the_customer_first__jobs_to_be_done","id":"92c3c6fd-7357-4afe-a7da-bd975f47dc96","name":"Putting the Customer First: Jobs-to-be-Done","type":"Talk","speakers":[{"codename":"matt_barthelemy__fitbit","id":"c570c12c-b227-4582-8fa4-8ee50d05b309","first_name":"Matt","last_name":"Barthelemy","job_title":"Global Head of UX","company":"FitBit","country":"USA","bio":"<p>For over 20 years, Matt has been making new products and new technologies accessible, attractive, and effective for people.

This is, at some level, the fundamental promise of all technology. Yet if we don't pay close enough attention, our own tools can sometimes get the better of us. Whether it's a team using a prescribed design process, or a company building software to be used by the entire planet, it turns out that these tools can be used in unintended ways. They can break, or grow out of control. And so our job as designers is not just to build things, but sometimes to recognise when we need to take them apart again.

By expanding the DevOps loop to include the Research, Hypothesis and Design stages it forces teams to validate their assumptions about new features before building them.</p>\n<p>Outcome-Driven development relies on the product team defining the outcomes that they expect to achieve with each feature. These outcomes are documented as hypotheses as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>We believe that (feature)&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Will result in (outcome - aligned to product purpose)&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>And we will prove it based on (measurable metric)&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Within (time period)&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The hypothesis structure allows teams to remove their bias towards features and verify whether their assumptions about a feature hold true. The design step, while not mandatory for every feature, encourages teams to validate their assumptions without writing any code. If, after the Research or Design steps, the hypothesis doesn't hold true it forces the team to update their understanding of their customers.

Privacy policies are hard to make fun but we've done our best at simplification. Like all companies, we process customer information. UXDX collects, uses and stores information about users of our websites and attendees at our conferences. This means that we process your personal data or information and it is your right to know how we use this information.</p>\n<h3>What can you ask us for?</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>How we use your information</li>\n  <li>Who we pass it to</li>\n  <li>For a copy of the information we, hold on you</li>\n  <li>To correct it if the information is wrong</li>\n  <li>To erase the information we hold on you</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As an organisation we will:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Not allow the information to be used or seen by anyone who should not see it</li>\n  <li>Give you a copy of your personal information if you ask for it within 1 month of verifying your request</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3><strong>Why do we collect personal information about you?</strong></h3>\n<p>We collect information to allow us to carry out the work of UXDX delivering conferences, networking and business development solutions. We&nbsp;<strong>never&nbsp;</strong>sell your information! Collection falls into a number of categories:</p>\n<h4>Event Execution</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>We need to track your personal details (name, contact info and job details) in order to enable you to access the event and tailor the messaging and content appropriately for you.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>We review attendee role and industry demographics to validate that we are delivering the right content for you.</li>\n  <li>We share the attendee list of the events to enable networking and increase the value of the event to our attendees (we will only ever share you name and company details, we will&nbsp;<strong>never</strong>&nbsp;share contact details)</li>\n  <li>We will use your information to identify the best services and products in the market that would be relevant for you. We then partner with relevant companies to enable the delivery of the events. As stated above we do not sell your information and we do not share individual contact details with third party vendors, but the aggregated data is used to demonstrate value to these companies.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Legal Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>We need to keep records for legal and accounting purposes</li>\n  <li>We will use your information for our own internal record keeping</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Marketing</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>Like any good UX company, we review website statistics to validate our marketing / copy and design experiments. By tracking the number of hits, page movements through the site, site re-visits, referral links and other analytical metrics we are able to determine the success of our experiments and improve our offering to you.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>We review marketing success and failures in order to understand and validate the benefit offering of our conferences.</li>\n  <li>We conduct primary research to identify people who would benefit from our conferences and events.</li>\n  <li>We allow people to subscribe to our newsletter</li>\n  <li>We inform you of our offerings which we believe are relevant for you. You are free to remove consent at any time and all emails will include a single click unsubscribe option.</li>\n  <li>We promote photos and videos of the conferences. You may be visible in these artifacts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you register for an event this includes your consent to UXDX processing your information in line with this Privacy Policy.

These lists include your name, job title, company and social media links. We&nbsp;<strong>never&nbsp;</strong>share contact details.</p>\n<h4>Photographs / Video</h4>\n<p>We take photos/videos at our events to share with people who could not attend. There is a chance that you will be vvisible in these recordings if you attend the event.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Aggregated Data</h4>\n<p>We can't afford to run our events without the support of our partners.

We&nbsp;<strong>never&nbsp;</strong>share contact information with partners.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3><strong>How long do we keep your information?</strong></h3>\n<p>We will keep your details on file indefinitely as it enables us to understand our past interactions with you and enable us to better tailor our product to you over time.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3><strong>How to get a copy of the information we hold on you</strong></h3>\n<p>You have the right to make a Data Subject Access Request to receive a copy of the information we hold about you.

Any substitutions or alterations will be updated on our web page as soon as possible.</p>\n<h1>Delivery Policy</h1>\n<p>Once a successful purchase transaction has been completed, tickets are delivered in electronic soft-copy via email to the email address nominated by the purchaser. For some ticket types it may be necessary to complete required information - such as attendee name - before the tickets can be issued. The ticket acts as a receipt for the transaction and can be used to redeem entry at the event listed on the ticket. A printed hard-copy ticket or an electronic soft-copy ticket detailing the reference number can be used to register at the event.</p>\n<h1>Refund and Cancellation Policy</h1>\n<p>All purchases of tickets for conferences and events (including hotel rooms if applicable) are non-refundable in their entirety. Your ticket remains the property of UXDX and is a personal revocable license, which may be withdrawn, and admission refused at any time upon a refund of the printed registration price.</p>\n<p>In the unlikely event of cancellation of a conference or event the liability of UXDX&nbsp; is limited to the share of paid registration fees that remains after credit card and payment processing fees have been incurred and deducted.</p>\n<p>It is strictly forbidden for any company, organisation or attendee to attempt to host or organise any event in conjunction with, contiguous to or purporting to be related to UXDX or its affiliates without the express prior permission and cooperation of UXDX. In the event of breach of these terms any tickets purchased by the organiser and their affiliates will be rendered null and void. UXDX reserves their right to take such legal action including a claim for damages as may be appropriate.</p>\n<h3>You Can't Resell your Ticket</h3>\n<p>The tickets purchased (including hotel rooms if applicable) are for your own personal use or that of your business only and may not be re-sold or transferred for commercial gain under any circumstances, including but not limited to use as part of any promotion or competition. Where there has been any resale or attempted resale of any tickets (or any other breach of this term), we reserve the right to cancel the relevant tickets with immediate effect.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to cancel any ticket purchase made by any person or body whom we reasonably believe to be associated with any ticket broker or tout. UXDX reserves the right to refuse admission to any event or conference for any behaviour, which it deems unacceptable, contravenes our Code of Conduct, or for breach of the terms and conditions.</p>\n<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>\n<p>Whilst we will use reasonable endeavours to verify the accuracy of any information we place on the website/mobile app, we make no warranties, whether express or implied in relation to its accuracy.

With a wide range of experience from working as an investment professional at legendary private equity firm GTCR to working as a product manager at Microsoft to serving as CEO of Strategyn, Jay has seen first-hand the problems that executives and product teams confront when trying to satisfy customers and generate growth and equity value for shareholders. Jay is an innovation thought-leader who has contributed significant advancements to jobs-to- be-done methods. Jay's advancements enable product teams to dramatically increase their effectiveness in using jobs-to-be-done to reduce roadmap risk, accelerate revenue growth, and generate superior equity value. Jobs-to-be-done product management helps CEOs align their product teams with customers and focus their company's product development on exploiting competitor weaknesses from the view of the customer.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Jobs-to-be-done is the best way for CEOs and company boards to assess and mitigate product roadmap risk because it reveals the unambiguous and actionable metrics that customers use to judge product satisfaction. thrv was created from Jay's years of experience working with CEOs, boards, and product teams in a diverse range of industries from B2B to B2C to medical. While at the Harvard Business School, Jay studied with Clay Christensen, who pioneered the concept of disruption and popularized the jobs-to-be-done innovation method.

He focuses on ideation and then forging a reasonable plan for solutions that people would love to use and that would maximise the Business value of the Product at the same time. Over the 13 years of his experience, Dominik collaborated on the production of many solutions, ranging from marketing initiatives to complex back office and collaboration tools, heavy-data analytical dashboards, bespoke mobile apps, e-shops, and process-oriented systems. This usually concerned running workshops, working on strategy, wireframing, and agile product development.

UXDX conf is based around the UXDX model which integrates UX into the Development loop by breaking down the barriers between development, design and research teams. The UXDX model promotes outcome-driven product development instead of the traditional feature-approach. By expanding the DevOps loop to include the Research, Hypothesis and Design stages, it forces teams to validate assumptions about new features before building them. UXDX understands the vitality and importance of fulfilled, highly skilled and outcome driven designers.
