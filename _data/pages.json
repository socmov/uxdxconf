Storypointing, MVPs, spikes and an iterative approach all help towards a goal of better software estimation and so success of a project, but the best, single most important element I have seen is the existence of trust between a software team and product owner.&nbsp; On the product owner that they wont make promises to the business based on estimates and on the software team that they will give an honest assessment of the work involved and not inflate estimates.</p>\n<p>When it works it is a powerful thing and is a million times more effective than the 'them' and 'us' attitudes that exist in some places and that do nobody any good.</p>","questions":"<p><br></p>","conference":[],"youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xgyK5QAPrGQ","slides":"https://www.slideshare.net/UXDXConf/how-long-is-a-piece-of-string-the-key-to-solving-the-conundrum-of-software-estimation"}],"location":"Execution","stream":[{"codename":"architecting_for_change","id":"7a32af60-8bb2-40c3-b8b9-76747beeed13","name":"Architecting for Change","conference":[]}],"conference":[]},{"codename":"oct_8__2019__10_35_am_vision_break","id":"7e566e35-19ae-4e7e-827e-3d5fca5e922c","start_time":"2019-10-08T10:35:00Z","duration__mins_":null,"session":[{"codename":"break_98288aa","id":"98288aac-1cb6-4aba-988d-40129fd108be","name":"Break","type":"Break","speakers":[],"description":"<p><br></p>","questions":"<p><br></p>","conference":["uxdx18"],"youtube":"","slides":""}],"location":"Vision","stream":[{"codename":"break_vision","id":"df9727c1-3b3a-452e-a4c2-4221ff04b1e2","name":"Break","conference":[]}],"conference":[]},{"codename":"oct_8__2019__11_10_am_execution_break","id":"708a1b74-35cb-49ca-90a0-c86f70b24730","start_time":"2019-10-08T11:10:00Z","duration__mins_":null,"session":[{"codename":"break_98288aa","id":"98288aac-1cb6-4aba-988d-40129fd108be","name":"Break","type":"Break","speakers":[],"description":"<p><br></p>","questions":"<p><br></p>","conference":["uxdx18"],"youtube":"","slides":""}],"location":"Execution","stream":[{"codename":"break__execution","id":"97f3b9c7-330e-43f8-878e-c5c84bb10d62","name":"Break- Execution","conference":[]}],"conference":[]},{"codename":"oct_8__2019__11_10_am_vision_aligning_business_and","id":"4cf0c179-74aa-4970-a56c-c8073f718293","start_time":"2019-10-08T11:10:00Z","duration__mins_":null,"session":[{"codename":"aligning_business_and_customer_outcomes","id":"ca9d0059-3dd4-40d2-90aa-5526c1f08c15","name":"Aligning Business and Customer Outcomes","type":"Talk","speakers":[{"codename":"sebastien_fabre___lego","id":"88782bbd-3b58-4488-9b07-82492cc56dcf","first_name":"Sebastien ","last_name":"Fabre","job_title":"Head of UX, Mobile & Portals","company":"LEGO Group","country":"Denmark","bio":"<p>Sebastien&nbsp;Fabre is Senior Director and Head of UX, Mobile &amp; Portals at LEGO Group, with strategic and tactical ownership of the User Experience agenda within Business Technology.</p>\n<p>Postgraduate Human Factors Engineer and Analyst Programmer Engineer with 18 years international industry experience in user-centered design, Sebastien worked previously at Fujitsu in Munich where he started from scratch, grew and managed the Design, UX Research &amp; Usability team.

The role is key for increasing the awareness of the UXDX brand and driving sales for our conferences and training courses. The ideal candidate will have a solid background in analytics, data segmentation and cross channel marketing campaign planning and execution. Comfort with data and SQL is a bonus.</p>\n<h3>What's in it for you?</h3>\n<p>This is an incredible opportunity to make a meaningful impact on the future of a young, but fast growing company. You will be working directly with the company directors and helping to set the strategy for the company. You could stay marketing in a large organisation where things move slowly and you have limited responsibilities / ability to stretch yourself or you could join UXDX and take the responsibility and ownership that you want. Be warned though that this is a double edged sword - your career progression will be quicker, but it will require a lot of hard work and stepping outside of your comfort zone.</p>\n<h3>Key Responsibilities</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Marketing</li>\n  <li>Research and identify areas for improvements and growth</li>\n  <li>Segment design and creation</li>\n  <li>Content Strategy that aligns to what each segment is</li>\n  <li>Consistent marketing campaign across multiple digital channels (Blog, email, social)</li>\n  <li>Paid marketing campaigns</li>\n  <li>Conference Sales Strategy</li>\n  <li>Pricing and promotional ideas for the conference</li>\n  <li>PR/ Content</li>\n  <li>Identify areas for gaining additional publicity that align to the needs of our segments</li>\n  <li>Create the 'pitch' that gets our content where it needs to be</li>\n  <li>Come up with ideas for growth of our content and platform</li>\n  <li>Data-Informed</li>\n  <li>Website and marketing channel analytics</li>\n  <li>Defining goals and tracking effectiveness of campaigns</li>\n  <li>Analysis of data to deliver consumer-led insights and initiatives for growth / continuous improvement</li>\n  <li>Qualitative research with users to validate quantitative data and test insights</li>\n  <li>Team work</li>\n  <li>Work closely with our Sales, Production, IT and Fulfillment teams.</li>\n  <li>Strong communication skills</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Skills / Qualifications</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Experiment Mindset</li>\n  <li>Everyone has an opinion - how can you prove that your marketing ideas are working.</li>\n  <li>Small tests - if they work then double down</li>\n  <li>Experience using brand mapping and brand planning tools</li>\n  <li>Proven track-record in delivering outstanding marketing campaigns</li>\n  <li>SQL / strong Excel skills critical</li>\n  <li>Start-up experience is a real bonus - experience with juggling many balls</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Benefits</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Remote working - work from anywhere within Europe (we value team collaboration which means we need to be awake at the same time)</li>\n  <li>Annual company retreat - last year we went to Bali</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>About Us</h3>\n<p>We are changing software development. A lot of companies manage software according to 20th Century practices, with 20th Century software results. We are helping companies to shift away from projects, which deliver outputs, to product teams, who are responsible for business outcomes. We deliver this through our conferences and training offerings which provide motivating case studies from companies who have made the shift as well as the skills and knowledge required to adopt better ways of working. Our key event has grown from zero to over 1,500 attendees in four years, with a core audience profile of UX researchers, UI designers, developers and product managers. We've been growing a lot - but we're just getting started!</p>\n<h3>How to Apply</h3>\n<p>Does this role sound like a good fit?

You will be responsible for the core IT systems as well as getting your hands dirty in the code of our internal systems and website. You will have direct support from our technical co-founder when required but you will be given the space to demonstrate your skill and drive.</p>\n<h3>What's in it for you?</h3>\n<p>This is an incredible opportunity to make a meaningful impact on the future of a young, but fast growing company. You will be working directly with the company directors and helping to set the strategy for the company. You will get a lot more responsibility and ownership than in traditional companies, which is a double edged sword - your career progression will be quicker, but it will require a lot of hard work, experimenting and automating processes and approaches to save time, costs and improve delivery.</p>\n<h3>Responsibilities</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Own the Website: our core marketing and fulfillment platform</li>\n  <li>Information architecture - you need to be able to think through data structures to ensure a maintainable component hierarchy</li>\n  <li>Ability to create new components as required (Our website is built in Vue and managed by a headless CMS)</li>\n  <li>Partner closely with marketing, production and sales to deliver solutions for their needs - coming up with ideas for an easy sales funnel online</li>\n  <li>Own our internal IT systems: our productivity engine</li>\n  <li>Identify the best solutions for internal system management (CRM, Marketing, Sales etc.), with a strong preference for SaaS solutions</li>\n  <li>Manage and improve our internal, bespoke, lead generation platform (NodeJS, SQL and third party SaaS solutions)</li>\n  <li>Think through the TCO of Build versus Buy</li>\n  <li>Ability to write lambda functions to integrate systems where necessary</li>\n  <li>Data Interrogation</li>\n  <li>Ability to query our contacts DB to help sales and marketing to identify segments and opportunities as required</li>\n  <li>Data Cleansing investigation and updates</li>\n  <li>Data pattern matching and ideation</li>\n  <li>Always thinking of recovery (e.g. how to revert if a data update goes wrong - backups!)</li>\n  <li>Team work</li>\n  <li>Work closely with our Sales, Marketing, Production and Fulfillment teams.</li>\n  <li>Strong communication skills</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Skills / Qualifications</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>4+ years experience as a problem solver</li>\n  <li>Excellent communication skills</li>\n  <li>Deep understanding of technology</li>\n  <li>Flexible and focussed on solutions</li>\n  <li>Organized and self-sufficient</li>\n  <li>NodeJS</li>\n  <li>SQL</li>\n  <li>Experience with Analytics a bonus</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Benefits</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Remote working - work from anywhere within Europe/ Africa (we value team collaboration which means we need to be awake at the same time)</li>\n  <li>Annual company working retreat - last year we went to Bali</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>About Us</h3>\n<p>We are changing software development. A lot of companies manage software according to 20th Century practices, with 20th Century software results. We are helping companies to shift away from projects, which deliver outputs, to product teams, who are responsible for business outcomes. We deliver this through our conferences and training offerings which provide motivating case studies from companies who have made the shift as well as the skills and knowledge required to adopt better ways of working. Our key event has grown from zero to over 1,500 attendees in four years, with a core audience profile of UX researchers, UI designers, developers and product managers. We've been growing a lot - but we're just getting started!</p>\n<h3>How to Apply</h3>\n<p>Does this role sound like a good fit?

UXDX shall assume no liability whatsoever in the circumstances that an event is cancelled, rescheduled or postponed due to a fortuitous event, Act of God, unforeseen occurrence or any other event that renders performance of an event impracticable, illegal or impossible. For purposes of this clause, a fortuitous event shall include, but not be limited to: war, fire, labour strike, extreme weather or other emergency.</p>\n<p><br>\nPlease note that while speakers and topics are confirmed at the time of publishing, circumstances beyond the control of the organisers may necessitate substitutions, alterations or cancellations of the speakers and/or topics. As such, UXDX reserves the right to alter or modify the advertised speakers and/or topics if necessary without any liability to you whatsoever. Any substitutions or alterations will be updated on our web page as soon as possible.</p>\n<h1>Delivery Policy</h1>\n<p>Once a successful purchase transaction has been completed, tickets are delivered in electronic soft-copy via email to the email address nominated by the purchaser. For some ticket types it may be necessary to complete required information - such as attendee name - before the tickets can be issued. The ticket acts as a receipt for the transaction and can be used to redeem entry at the event listed on the ticket. A printed hard-copy ticket or an electronic soft-copy ticket detailing the reference number can be used to register at the event.</p>\n<h1>Refund and Cancellation Policy</h1>\n<p>All purchases of tickets for conferences and events (including hotel rooms if applicable) are non-refundable in their entirety. Your ticket remains the property of UXDX and is a personal revocable license, which may be withdrawn, and admission refused at any time upon a refund of the printed registration price.</p>\n<p>In the unlikely event of cancellation of a conference or event the liability of UXDX&nbsp; is limited to the share of paid registration fees that remains after credit card and payment processing fees have been incurred and deducted.</p>\n<p>It is strictly forbidden for any company, organisation or attendee to attempt to host or organise any event in conjunction with, contiguous to or purporting to be related to UXDX or its affiliates without the express prior permission and cooperation of UXDX. In the event of breach of these terms any tickets purchased by the organiser and their affiliates will be rendered null and void. UXDX reserves their right to take such legal action including a claim for damages as may be appropriate.</p>\n<h3>You Can't Resell your Ticket</h3>\n<p>The tickets purchased (including hotel rooms if applicable) are for your own personal use or that of your business only and may not be re-sold or transferred for commercial gain under any circumstances, including but not limited to use as part of any promotion or competition. Where there has been any resale or attempted resale of any tickets (or any other breach of this term), we reserve the right to cancel the relevant tickets with immediate effect.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to cancel any ticket purchase made by any person or body whom we reasonably believe to be associated with any ticket broker or tout. UXDX reserves the right to refuse admission to any event or conference for any behaviour, which it deems unacceptable, contravenes our Code of Conduct, or for breach of the terms and conditions.</p>\n<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>\n<p>Whilst we will use reasonable endeavours to verify the accuracy of any information we place on the website/mobile app, we make no warranties, whether express or implied in relation to its accuracy.

There is no point in re-inventing the wheel on the commodity functionality that customers take for granted. When it comes to securing the various types of applications you may be wondering what the right approach is. It may seem that with each new architecture, the rules of security get rewritten. JSON Web Tokens, Open ID, Authentication Flows, Oh My!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this workshop, you'll look at how to demystify common security patterns for various types of modern app architectures. Your trainer, Ado, will go over modern OAuth Flows and how they work, different architecture scenarios, and then in the labs. Next, you'll put theory to practice by applying the concepts we learn by building and securing a real-world application. You'll utilise the Auth0 universal identity platform and show how we can easily implement Sign in with Apple as the example using social connections. We'll also cover best practices both on the frontend and backend to ensure our application is as secure as it can be. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","colour":"white","jumbotron":[],"cards":[],"testimonials":[],"stats":[],"buttons___widget":[],"data":[],"agenda":[],"image_rows":[],"form":[],"video_playlist":[],"horizontal_content":[],"map":[],"countdown":[],"ticket_widget":[],"blog_list":[],"questions":[],"training_cards":[],"video_highlight":[],"faqs":[],"table":[]},{"codename":"ado_kukic","id":"287d2876-d5dc-4694-b4a0-8e05c4433875","title":"","title2":"<p><br></p>","content":"<p><br></p>","colour":[],"jumbotron":[],"cards":[],"testimonials":[],"stats":[],"buttons___widget":[],"data":[],"agenda":[],"image_rows":[],"form":[],"video_playlist":[],"horizontal_content":[{"codename":"ado_kukic__horizontal_content","id":"dcb91b3e-2a61-49cd-84a2-fc6a18addc58","image":[{"description":null,"url":"https://uxdxconf.com/images/kentico/0bd8d269-1888-4714-9630-7d543872c24f/ado-kukic.png","width":200,"height":200}],"image_type":"hexagon","equal_image_ratio":[],"title":"\nAdo Kukic, full-stack developer at Auth0","description":"<p>Ado is a full-stack developer, advocate, and developer evangelist at <a href=\"https://auth0.com/ambassador-program\">Auth0</a>.

More recently she has taken this concept and applied it as a confidence-building tool for older patients that are nervous about being discharged from hospital.

But people don't resist change, they resist being changed. I enjoy working with people to help bring them on the journey from projects to products tackling both the motivation and skills required to change.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lets empower teams to work together to build amazing products that customers love.</p>","order":34,"profile_picture":[{"description":"Rory Madden, CTO & CoFounder, UXDX","url":"https://uxdxconf.com/images/kentico/fc8bc817-9dc2-4861-a9e6-1533b8d5be47/-KuOMcqAMTJVPI0ZFQhw.jpg","width":200,"height":200}],"company_logo":[{"description":"UXDX","url":"https://uxdxconf.com/images/kentico/88eb267c-ae92-47a8-94d2-bd85937488b7/UXDX-text.svg"}],"twitter":"https://ie.linkedin.com/rorymadden","linkedin":"","github":"","instagram":"","conference":["staff","trainer","communitysanfran2020","communityoslo2020","communitystockholm2020","communitycopenhagen2020","communitylondon2020","communityamsterdam2020","communityberlin2020","communityparis2020","communitybarcelona2020","communityvienna2020","communitymunich2020","communitymanchester2020","communityhome","communityhelsinki2020"],"highlight":["communityspeakerhighlight20"]}],"description":"<p><br></p>","questions":"<p><br></p>","conference":["uxdxlondon19"],"youtube":"","slides":""}],"location":"Agenda London","stream":[],"conference":["uxdxlondon19"]},{"codename":"n13_25_problem_to_vision","id":"6ac2273d-f0e3-4048-8530-9273286f92a2","start_time":"2019-04-30T13:25:00Z","duration__mins_":null,"session":[{"codename":"problem_to_vision_ac7402a","id":"ac7402ac-9419-433d-9773-e5a44794ae27","name":"Getting a Good Product to Customers Quickly: How to be Agile and Move at Speed ","type":"Talk","speakers":[{"codename":"robert_cressy___bcg","id":"badb8b52-8f6b-4f57-8508-ca3607edb786","first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Cressy","job_title":"Director User Experience Design","company":"BCG Digital Ventures","country":"England","bio":"<p><br></p>","order":null,"profile_picture":[{"description":null,"url":"https://uxdxconf.com/images/kentico/0efe665a-760a-4092-8723-2569fcde639e/RobertCressyBCG.jpeg"}],"company_logo":[{"description":"bcg","url":"https://uxdxconf.com/images/kentico/ee43c387-2836-4711-8be4-c228a122791c/BCGDV.png"}],"twitter":"","linkedin":"","github":"","instagram":"","conference":["uxdxlondon19"],"highlight":[]}],"description":"<ul>\n  <li>Problem to validation: Research to design&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Qualitative research into quantitative research&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Lancing lean tests: Hypothesis \"bets\" validation</li>\n  <li>Defining the&nbsp;roadmap iteratively&nbsp;as we go</li>\n  <li>Adapting the team as the product matures - business outcomes initially, to UX, then towards engineering goals</li>\n</ul>","questions":"<p><br></p>","conference":["uxdxlondon19"],"youtube":"","slides":""}],"location":"Agenda London","stream":[],"conference":["uxdxlondon19"]},{"codename":"n13_50_team_structure","id":"2a819f5c-ce7e-4244-a581-27b80960f9c1","start_time":"2019-04-30T13:50:00Z","duration__mins_":null,"session":[{"codename":"n13_50_team_structure_1e7ee99","id":"1e7ee998-6b1a-4e32-ab1d-59144fa9b39f","name":"Creating the right culture for you team","type":"Talk","speakers":[{"codename":"jason_foo_worldremit","id":"f2553ecb-7dc4-41b8-9e2c-5b86cf967bf5","first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Foo","job_title":"Head of Product Design","company":"WorldRemit","country":"United Kingdom","bio":"<p>Jason is Head of Product Design at WorldRemit, where he leads Product Design efforts and a team of designers focused on creating compelling remittance experiences for customers, many of whom are migrants who send money home to family, friends and loved ones.

I co-founded UXDX in 2016 to accelerate the transition from projects to cross-functional product teams; moving the focus away from following process at all costs to delivering real customer and business value.</p>\n<p>Organisations are primarily structured in functional silos, which are great in low change environments, but product development is the 21st Century is fast paced.
