With a wide range of experience from working as an investment professional at legendary private equity firm GTCR to working as a product manager at Microsoft to serving as CEO of Strategyn, Jay has seen first-hand the problems that executives and product teams confront when trying to satisfy customers and generate growth and equity value for shareholders. Jay is an innovation thought-leader who has contributed significant advancements to jobs-to- be-done methods. Jay's advancements enable product teams to dramatically increase their effectiveness in using jobs-to-be-done to reduce roadmap risk, accelerate revenue growth, and generate superior equity value. Jobs-to-be-done product management helps CEOs align their product teams with customers and focus their company's product development on exploiting competitor weaknesses from the view of the customer.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Jobs-to-be-done is the best way for CEOs and company boards to assess and mitigate product roadmap risk because it reveals the unambiguous and actionable metrics that customers use to judge product satisfaction. thrv was created from Jay's years of experience working with CEOs, boards, and product teams in a diverse range of industries from B2B to B2C to medical. While at the Harvard Business School, Jay studied with Clay Christensen, who pioneered the concept of disruption and popularized the jobs-to-be-done innovation method. While serving as an Adjunct Professor at the Presidio School of Management, Jay developed methods to train executives and product managers to use jobs-to-be-done effectively. Before founding thrv, Jay served as CEO of Strategyn, where he worked with some of the world's leading companies to transform their product management into a customer-centric, jobs-to-be-done process. Jay graduated Phi Beta Kappa with highest honors from Brown University, and he received his MBA with distinction from Harvard Business School.</p>","order":14,"profile_picture":[{"description":"jay hynes","url":"https://uxdxconf.com/images/kentico/e4062c9f-a969-46dc-8600-66fdadc6f95b/jay-haynes.jpg"}],"company_logo":[{"description":"thrv","url":"https://uxdxconf.com/images/kentico/7083733e-0660-4817-a137-3c26f22f5110/thrv.svg"}],"twitter":"https://twitter.com/jayhaynes?lang=en","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayhaynes/","github":"","instagram":"","conference":["uxdx18","trainer"],"highlight":["product"]}],"description":"<p><br></p>","questions":"<p><br></p>","conference":["uxdx18"]}],"location":"Vision","stream":[],"conference":["uxdx18"]},{"codename":"n09_30__04_10_2018__execution__web_components","id":"def4c735-c0ae-4184-88ab-3cf53047d1bf","start_time":"2018-10-04T09:30:00Z","duration__mins_":30,"session":[{"codename":"microfrontend_architecture","id":"1f22003b-2765-496f-aaa2-13aad1dcd50c","name":"Micro Frontend Architecture","type":"Talk","speakers":[{"codename":"speaker_luca_mezzalira","id":"4194621c-9d10-4b1f-b6fb-bd9aa11458ad","first_name":"Luca","last_name":"Mezzalira","job_title":"Chief Architect","company":"DAZN","country":"Germany","bio":"<p>Luca a Chief Architect with 15 years of experience, a Google Developer Expert on Web Technologies and the London Javascript community Manager<br>\nHe has had the chance to work on cutting-edge projects for mobile, desktop, web, TVs, set top boxes and embedded devices.<br>\nHe's currently managing DAZN, a sports video platform based on the cloud with millions of users that are watching live and on-demand contents.<br>\n<br>\nHe's the author of Front-End Reactive Architectures published by APress:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://goo.gl/ywAmsx\">https://goo.gl/ywAmsx</a><br>\n<br>\nLuca says the best way to use any programming language is mastering their models, that's why he spent a lot of time studying and researching on topics like OOP, Functional and Reactive programming.<br>\n<br>\nIn his spare time, Luca writes for national and international technical magazines and editors, he's also a technical reviewer for APress, Packt Publishing, Pragmatic Bookshelf and O'Reilly.</p>","order":10,"profile_picture":[{"description":"Image of Luca Mezzalira","url":"https://uxdxconf.com/images/kentico/8d650268-c365-4805-b58f-4aa86ed4bcad/Luca-DAZN2.jpg"}],"company_logo":[{"description":"DAZN logo","url":"https://uxdxconf.com/images/kentico/e1f10e8d-a88b-436c-ad86-6deb8f75ffb5/Logo-White-on-black21.jpg"}],"twitter":"https://twitter.com/lucamezzalira","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucamezzalira/","github":"https://github.com/lucamezzalira","instagram":"","conference":["uxdx18"],"highlight":["dx","dx18"]}],"description":"<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/TFYNlcat1A8\">https://youtu.be/TFYNlcat1A8</a></p>","questions":"<p><br></p>","conference":["uxdx18"]}],"location":"Execution","stream":[{"codename":"build","id":"69c40012-7e13-434f-8a26-fff2afb0ff94","name":"Build","conference":["uxdx18","uxdxstockholm18"]}],"conference":["uxdx18"]},{"codename":"n09_30__04_10_18__vision__jobs_to_be_done","id":"953143a1-d9d5-4663-88be-6b4ab5e11eba","start_time":"2018-10-04T09:30:00Z","duration__mins_":30,"session":[{"codename":"putting_the_customer_first__jobs_to_be_done","id":"92c3c6fd-7357-4afe-a7da-bd975f47dc96","name":"Putting the Customer First: Jobs-to-be-Done","type":"Talk","speakers":[{"codename":"matt_barthelemy__fitbit","id":"c570c12c-b227-4582-8fa4-8ee50d05b309","first_name":"Matt","last_name":"Barthelemy","job_title":"Global Head of UX","company":"FitBit","country":"USA","bio":"<p>For over 20 years, Matt has been making new products and new technologies accessible, attractive, and effective for people.

Whether it's a team using a prescribed design process, or a company building software to be used by the entire planet, it turns out that these tools can be used in unintended ways. They can break, or grow out of control. And so our job as designers is not just to build things, but sometimes to recognise when we need to take them apart again.

With a wide range of experience from working as an investment professional at legendary private equity firm GTCR to working as a product manager at Microsoft to serving as CEO of Strategyn, Jay has seen first-hand the problems that executives and product teams confront when trying to satisfy customers and generate growth and equity value for shareholders. Jay is an innovation thought-leader who has contributed significant advancements to jobs-to- be-done methods. Jay's advancements enable product teams to dramatically increase their effectiveness in using jobs-to-be-done to reduce roadmap risk, accelerate revenue growth, and generate superior equity value.

While at the Harvard Business School, Jay studied with Clay Christensen, who pioneered the concept of disruption and popularized the jobs-to-be-done innovation method. While serving as an Adjunct Professor at the Presidio School of Management, Jay developed methods to train executives and product managers to use jobs-to-be-done effectively. Before founding thrv, Jay served as CEO of Strategyn, where he worked with some of the world's leading companies to transform their product management into a customer-centric, jobs-to-be-done process.

Whether it's a team using a prescribed design process, or a company building software to be used by the entire planet, it turns out that these tools can be used in unintended ways. They can break, or grow out of control. And so our job as designers is not just to build things, but sometimes to recognise when we need to take them apart again.
