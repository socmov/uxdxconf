Writing software is very rarely like painting a room, where a person can reasonably give an estimate to the nearest day.</p>\n<p>Between tech debt, lack of useful documentation and a new requirement never done before, it is very hard for a software team and the lead developer to come up with what the business often wants - an accurate estimate! (if such a thing were possible).</p>\n<p>So, what is the solution? Storypointing, MVPs, spikes and an iterative approach all help towards a goal of better software estimation and so success of a project, but the best, single most important element I have seen is the existence of trust between a software team and product owner.&nbsp; On the product owner that they wont make promises to the business based on estimates and on the software team that they will give an honest assessment of the work involved and not inflate estimates.</p>\n<p>When it works it is a powerful thing and is a million times more effective than the 'them' and 'us' attitudes that exist in some places and that do nobody any good.</p>","questions":"<p><br></p>","conference":[],"youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xgyK5QAPrGQ","slides":"https://www.slideshare.net/UXDXConf/how-long-is-a-piece-of-string-the-key-to-solving-the-conundrum-of-software-estimation"}],"location":"Execution","stream":[{"codename":"architecting_for_change","id":"7a32af60-8bb2-40c3-b8b9-76747beeed13","name":"Architecting for Change","conference":[]}],"conference":[]},{"codename":"oct_8__2019__10_35_am_vision_break","id":"7e566e35-19ae-4e7e-827e-3d5fca5e922c","start_time":"2019-10-08T10:35:00Z","duration__mins_":null,"session":[{"codename":"break_98288aa","id":"98288aac-1cb6-4aba-988d-40129fd108be","name":"Break","type":"Break","speakers":[],"description":"<p><br></p>","questions":"<p><br></p>","conference":["uxdx18"],"youtube":"","slides":""}],"location":"Vision","stream":[{"codename":"break_vision","id":"df9727c1-3b3a-452e-a4c2-4221ff04b1e2","name":"Break","conference":[]}],"conference":[]}],"2019-10-08T11:10:00Z":[{"codename":"oct_8__2019__11_10_am_execution_break","id":"708a1b74-35cb-49ca-90a0-c86f70b24730","start_time":"2019-10-08T11:10:00Z","duration__mins_":null,"session":[{"codename":"break_98288aa","id":"98288aac-1cb6-4aba-988d-40129fd108be","name":"Break","type":"Break","speakers":[],"description":"<p><br></p>","questions":"<p><br></p>","conference":["uxdx18"],"youtube":"","slides":""}],"location":"Execution","stream":[{"codename":"break__execution","id":"97f3b9c7-330e-43f8-878e-c5c84bb10d62","name":"Break- Execution","conference":[]}],"conference":[]},{"codename":"oct_8__2019__11_10_am_vision_aligning_business_and","id":"4cf0c179-74aa-4970-a56c-c8073f718293","start_time":"2019-10-08T11:10:00Z","duration__mins_":null,"session":[{"codename":"aligning_business_and_customer_outcomes","id":"ca9d0059-3dd4-40d2-90aa-5526c1f08c15","name":"Aligning Business and Customer Outcomes","type":"Talk","speakers":[{"codename":"sebastien_fabre___lego","id":"88782bbd-3b58-4488-9b07-82492cc56dcf","first_name":"Sebastien ","last_name":"Fabre","job_title":"Head of UX, Mobile & Portals","company":"LEGO Group","country":"Denmark","bio":"<p>Sebastien&nbsp;Fabre is Senior Director and Head of UX, Mobile &amp; Portals at LEGO Group, with strategic and tactical ownership of the User Experience agenda within Business Technology.</p>\n<p>Postgraduate Human Factors Engineer and Analyst Programmer Engineer with 18 years international industry experience in user-centered design, Sebastien worked previously at Fujitsu in Munich where he started from scratch, grew and managed the Design, UX Research &amp; Usability team.
