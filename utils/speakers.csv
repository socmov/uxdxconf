"Rory","Madden","Founder","UXDX","<p>My goal is to shift from delivering software to delivering products that work. I co-founded UXDX in 2016 to accelerate the transition from projects to cross-functional product teams; moving the focus away from following process at all costs to delivering real customer and business value.</p>
<p>Organisations are primarily structured in functional silos, which are great in low change environments, but product development is the 21st Century is fast paced. Cross functional product teams which cut across traditional functional and department boundaries enable teams to focus on the outcomes that they want to deliver and avoid the politics and blockers that slow down delivery.</p>
<p>Shifting to product teams requires changes to organisational culture and structures, and change is hard. But people don't resist change, they resist being changed. I enjoy working with people to help bring them on the journey from projects to products tackling both the motivation and skills required to change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lets empower teams to work together to build amazing products that customers love.</p>","","https://ie.linkedin.com/rorymadden","https://uxdxconf.com/images/kentico/fc8bc817-9dc2-4861-a9e6-1533b8d5be47/-KuOMcqAMTJVPI0ZFQhw.jpg","106d42bf-7100-461a-a7dd-25aefc94bf7e"

"Mike","De Boer","Engineering Manager","Mozilla","<p>Engineering Manager at Mozilla, but really often imposts being a software engineer, open source enthusiast, writer, speaker, sailor or art lover. Working on Firefox is my fun past-time of choice at the moment, but there were times when I thoroughly enjoyed being part of the Amsterdam startup scene, organise AmsterdamJS meetups, speak at technology conferences and work on many exciting projects and technologies that coined many a term before they became mainstream. It all started with an open mind that's always eager to wager a challenge and learn something new. I work from home full-time and live there with my wife, our little boy who's just over a year old and Jack Russell, Pippa. Sure, I'm bad at separating work and personal life!&nbsp;</p>","https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikedeboer/?originalSubdomain=nl","https://twitter.com/mikedeboer","https://uxdxconf.com/images/kentico/c4b01121-aad4-441d-a6a5-89ba689d15f2/Mozilla.jpg","58fed298-049e-4796-bcb4-62d865534e75"

"Jussi","Ahola","Designer & Strategist","Vincit","<p>As a designer and strategist at Vincit, I steer design and product teams in crafting socio-technical systems, products, and strategies that move things forward. My vision is to create products I can take responsibility for, products that have a soul. Anyone who has ever worked in this field will know that getting to the point where a product starts to feel like it has a personality, maybe even a soul, so many things need to be just right. I want to get constantly better at this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe that products should be designed and built with purpose and integrity. Having witnessed first-hand the impact that products and socio-technical systems can have on people's behaviour and our environment, I want to harness this power to do good things.</p>
<p>I have been fortunate to work on some very ambitious products and services, which have earned some awards and press coverage along the years. Earlier I have also co-founded Deft Division, an ongoing side hustle where we have successfully experimented with advanced growth hacking methods and pricing models. At the moment I'm working on something entirely new, a social startup building a platform for climate action.</p>
<p>So, 2 parts designer, 2 parts idealist, 1 part entrepreneur, 1 part writer. Sometimes I feel like there are too many parts.</p>","","","https://uxdxconf.com/images/kentico/8b2bfddb-0104-4df3-aac4-c500cdf6a4b7/JussiAholaVincet.jpg","abc0382c-9cea-4fa0-9078-5582c3be0993"
