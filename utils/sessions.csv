But one decision made in isolation can seem right at the time, yet lead to a fractured user experience overall. How can companies optimise for responsiveness and reduce design entropy? This case study explains how we used design to implement system thinking into a 150-year-old bank.</p>","Morgane Peng",

How do organisations communicate the business goals without being directive in terms of the features that teams need to build? How does a team identify and set KPIs that are aligned to the business strategy? And how to avoid vanity metrics along the way?</p>","Conor Walsh",

As teams scale up their releases, managing the number of concurrent tests becomes more difficult.</p>

But is that the best way to describe what customers value in a product? Are there different types of value that consumers experience and desire? How do we discover, describe, and design for these different types of value? How can we use these insights to create growth for the business?</p>","Alan Klement",

You'll also come away with practical methods for prototyping your best design ideas for quick user feedback.&nbsp; The result is building more innovative and useful products with less risk.</p>","Jackie Scherer",

In this session, I will go over how I use user story mapping as a way of aligning everyone from SMEs to engineers on what we're building, why we're building it and most importantly how we should prioritize work.

<p>The goal is clear, restore site service as quickly as possible, but there can be many approaches to getting there.

Years later, we were almost crushed under the weight of the enormous technical debt we incurred and the ingrained hero culture we built while growing our business.

As software becomes a differentiator and speed becomes critical the overheads of projects becomes a challenge. In addition to the long lead times, the temporary nature of projects leads to overheads in team formation as well as a lack of code ownership which leads to the inevitable clean up projects. <br>

But often, building infrastructure products are treated as pure engineering practices and differentiated from feature products.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I would like to share my experience leading a team at BuzzFeed in building user-centric infrastructure products for our developers and data scientists, and how I integrate and adapt traditional PM techniques for technical products.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Building software for our peers is a double-edged sword. On one hand, our users are technologists themselves and have immense appreciation for well-designed infrastructure and tools. On the other hand, it is very tempting for us as developers to make assumptions about those folks with whom we work closely. When building tools for data scientists, it is especially crucial to keep in mind that they have their own distinct workflows and needs.</p>","Dot Gong",

More than 6 years later with four dedicated squads on that topic, it couldn't be even more true.</p>
<p>In this talk we'll look at how giving developers the tools they'll love to use results in a massive impact in the experience of the end users.

Writing software is very rarely like painting a room, where a person can reasonably give an estimate to the nearest day.</p>
<p>Between tech debt, lack of useful documentation and a new requirement never done before, it is very hard for a software team and the lead developer to come up with what the business often wants - an accurate estimate! (if such a thing were possible).</p>
<p>So, what is the solution? Storypointing, MVPs, spikes and an iterative approach all help towards a goal of better software estimation and so success of a project, but the best, single most important element I have seen is the existence of trust between a software team and product owner.&nbsp; On the product owner that they wont make promises to the business based on estimates and on the software team that they will give an honest assessment of the work involved and not inflate estimates.</p>
<p>When it works it is a powerful thing and is a million times more effective than the 'them' and 'us' attitudes that exist in some places and that do nobody any good.</p>","Jonathan Rigby",
