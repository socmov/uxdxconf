Ideally, the way that the process is outlined should be aligned with the business strategy. For example, if innovation is important for your business, you need a  process that supports innovation. If timely deliveries is more important, you need to adapt your process to that requirement.

But often, building infrastructure products are treated as pure engineering practices and differentiated from feature products.

I would like to share my experience leading a team at BuzzFeed in building user-centric infrastructure products for our developers and data scientists, and how I integrate and adapt traditional PM techniques for technical products.

Building software for our peers is a double-edged sword. On one hand, our users are technologists themselves and have immense appreciation for well-designed infrastructure and tools. On the other hand, it is very tempting for us as developers to make assumptions about those folks with whom we work closely. When building tools for data scientists, it is especially crucial to keep in mind that they have their own distinct workflows and needs.",uxdxeurope2019,Dot Gong,,,

Everything starts and ends with people, so show that you care. Your product team members need to feel and act like they are partners in crime. Dare to adapt your leadership style based on team needs and their maturity. Sometimes you will need to lead or guide them, and sometimes it will be better to just leave them alone. Organisational design is more important than you think. Choose the model that will allow you to deliver holistic user experience @ scale.

A vision should not only connect to business strategy, it should be stable enough to withstand new learnings and pivots across the product lifecycle.

Writing software is very rarely like painting a room, where a person can reasonably give an estimate to the nearest day.
Between tech debt, lack of useful documentation and a new requirement never done before, it is very hard for a software team and the lead developer to come up with what the business often wants - an accurate estimate! (if such a thing were possible).
So, what is the solution? Storypointing, MVPs, spikes and an iterative approach all help towards a goal of better software estimation and so success of a project, but the best, single most important element I have seen is the existence of trust between a software team and product owner.  On the product owner that they wont make promises to the business based on estimates and on the software team that they will give an honest assessment of the work involved and not inflate estimates.
When it works it is a powerful thing and is a million times more effective than the 'them' and 'us' attitudes that exist in some places and that do nobody any good.",uxdxeurope2019,Jonathan Rigby,,,

The world is going through a paradigm change. During decades as product designers all we were told to care about was to fulfil users needs and cater for their individualism. But that practice has created a few unexpected outcomes that go beyond the product itself. 
What about if by solving a User Centred issue we created a huge systematic, environmental or socioeconomic problem?

In this talk we'll look at how giving developers the tools they'll love to use results in a massive impact in the experience of the end users.

That's the starting point no matter what. That will always be how you address any product challenge. The classic way products were developed was you solved functional needs, and then maybe business needs, and then you lean heavily into human needs over time. This arc, all of the [PR] challenges aside, is a natural arc. The next big step is to become a company that's really, really good at connecting with people and people's needs.""",uxdxeurope2019,Michael  Gough,,,

How do you govern such a system? How do you handle contributions? Spotify has been on a journey reimagining what a Design System looks like for us. We're still on our journey but have scaled a steep learning curve, made mistakes and occasionally, found great success and we're ready to share our newly acquired knowledge with the design community.
